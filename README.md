# OpenGL-Animated-Scene
A visually rich animated 2D scene built with OpenGL in C++, featuring a rotating sun, drifting clouds, a windmill with spinning blades, and a detailed garden with flowers, a tree, and a house. This project demonstrates the use of transformations, primitive shapes, and real-time animation using GLUT.
